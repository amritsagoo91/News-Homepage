        <h3>New Marketplace Website</h3>
        <img src="images/Marketplace.jpg" alt="Marketplace" />
        <p>I am currently working with a team to create a marketplace type website, that sells used or second-hand goods. This site will allow
        users to create accounts, list items for sale, and purchase items from other users. We are using C# with MVC with HTML and CSS to create the project. The project is still in its design stages, but we hope to start development soon.
        This project will help me improve my skills in web development, database management, and MVC proficiency.

        <h3>Creative Commons Image Tool</h3>
        <img src="images/CreativeCommons.png" alt="Creative Commons" />
        <p>When searching for images on Google Images if you want something with the creative commons licence then you can go to the tools section on the far right of the menu 
        bar and select the usage rights dropdown. From there you can select the creative commons licence and it will filter out all images that do not have that licence.
        This is a useful tool for finding images that can be used for free, but it is important to always check the specific licence for each image to ensure that you are using it correctly and legally.
